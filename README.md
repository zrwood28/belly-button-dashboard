# belly-button-dashboard
Using html and javascript to create an informational dashboard about belly button data.

## Summary
Data was derived from a database containing demographic information and testing data gathered from each participant involving microbial species that were present
in their navel regions. The dashboard was formatted using html and the visual displays were created with javascript and the Plotly library. Each participant is represented by an anonymous identification number, and each one can be selected by the navigation bar. The bar graph and bubble graph provide a few visualizations that represent the microbes present per each participant. The demographic information section provides vague characteristics about each participant as well.
